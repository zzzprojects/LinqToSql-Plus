## Problem

You execute a method from the LinqToSql Plus library, and the following error is thrown:

{% include template-exception.html message='This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.' %}

## Solution

### Cause

The default algorithm to validate the license key & name is not supported with FIPS enabled.

### Fix

#### Ask for a compatible key

Contact us and we will send you a new key supporting FIPS: {% include infozzzprojects-email.html %}

Why donâ€™t we generated key compatible with FIPS by default? Because it will not be supported for a client machine with Windows XP or below.

#### Disable FIPS
