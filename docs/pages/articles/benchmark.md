## Problem
You perform benchmark tests for a method like BulkInsert, but you get very bad performance results.

### Solution
The performance issue may be caused by some common mistakes:

- Forget to JIT compile the library
- Include method not related to the test


## Forget to JIT compile the library
In C#, the code is compiled into IL by the compiler. Then when needed, the IL is compiled just-in-time (JIT) into the native assembly language of the host machine.

Additionally, some libraries like Entity Framework require some extra work like creating/reading the model. Some people report the first load taking several seconds
<!--
Entity Framework Extensions also takes some time to be compiled. It can take around 100ms the first time you use a method! So if you include it this time, your benchmark time is currently way higher than it should.!-->

### Solution
Invoke the method once before performing the benchmark tests

## Include method not related to the test
Someone once reported a performance issue and thought our BulkInsert method was slow. We discovered he was including the time to Add every entity to the context.

The Add method was taking 99,9% of the total time while BulkInsert only 0,1%.


| Operations | 100 Entities | 1,000 Entities | 10,000 Entities |
| :--------- | -----------: | -------------: | --------------: |
| Add        | 15 ms        | 1,050 ms       | 105,000 ms      |
| BulkInsert | 40 ms        | 90ms           | 400 ms          |


The Add method doesn't affect much the performance when adding 100 entities, but if you make your test with 10,000 entities:
 - Add: 99.6%
 - BulkInsert: 0,4%!

### Solution
Include only the method you want to benchmark.

## Good Example
Here is an example of how we normally do all our benchmarks tests
