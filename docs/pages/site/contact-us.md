If your project requests a feature we havenâ€™t thought of, please let us know using our [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/zzzprojects/LinqToSql-Plus/issues){:target="_blank"}

We will develop and implement it as soon as possible, sometimes the same day. You could also contact us directly:

We will do our best to accommodate you.
